# BAE

Everyone has been in meetings that were uneccessary and shuold have been emails. Bae is a full MERN stack webapp that aims to streamline the process of planing meetings and determining if it should actually be an email.

BAE presents you with a dashboard where you can write a list of things planned on being talked about.  Atendees can up/downvote the individial topics and if all the topics get enough downvotes, it tells you the meeting should just be an email.

We are utilizing Node.js, Express, React, and MongoDB in this app.
